## ðŸ’ƒ Introduction
* Welcome to the NextJS Recursive Menu App! ðŸš€

* This application is crafted using NextJS with TypeScript and seamlessly integrated with Jest for efficient testing.

### Key Features:

- **BFF Pattern with Server-Side Render:** Employing a server-side fetch, this app efficiently renders a server component by fetching and processing menu JSON.

- **Dynamic and Recursive Menu Rendering:** Enjoy a multi-layered menu that dynamically and recursively renders based on the fetched JSON data.

- **Secure Login Form:** The login form is powered by React Hook Form with a Yup resolver, ensuring robust validation. The validated form data is posted to the API route.

- **Testing with Jest:** Ensure the reliability of your codebase through unit tests using Jest.
